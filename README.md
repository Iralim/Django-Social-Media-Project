# Django-Social-Media-Project
A group project during training at Lexicon. 
The project is a social network with features for user registration, posting, and adding friends.
My part of the work involved developing two applications:
    posts_app, which includes essential functionality for working with posts, such as displaying, creating, updating, and deleting.
    contacts_app, which allows users to add other users as friends and manage their contacts.

# Django-Social-Media-Project

A group project during training at Lexicon.  
The project is a social network with features for user registration, posting, and adding friends.

## My Contribution

My part of the work involved developing two applications:

### 1. posts_app
- Includes essential functionality for working with posts, such as displaying, creating, updating, and deleting.

### 2. contacts_app
- Allows users to add other users as friends and manage their contacts.
